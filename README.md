# Semaphores
A C program that demonstrates the usage of semaphores and system programming. 

-Analysis of run-time-

The compilation time and actual run-time of the executable was fast and there was no lag during the execution. This is because I used the wait() function instead of sleep() so the parent process immediately execute after the child processes finish therefore everything seems instantaneous. The semaphores were created using the functions provided by the instructor and there were all created smoothly but there were some variables that needed to be declared manually for all the functions to work. The semaphores are then finally de-allocated before the end of the program by using the function provided.
